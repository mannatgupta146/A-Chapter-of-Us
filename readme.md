# A Chapter of Us

✨ A sweet, secret little project meant to open just one chapter from the story of us — only for the right person.

## About

## Features

- Secret code login interface  
- Personalized message upon success  
- Automatic redirection to a special page  
- Quirky and heartfelt response for incorrect codes  
- Clean and responsive design

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter the secret code (`madam`).
4. If it’s the right code, you'll be redirected to a personalized page (`main.html`).
5. If not, you'll receive a cheeky response that you’re not “Madam Ji.”

## Purpose

This project is more than code — it's a gesture. A chapter. A smile.  
Perfect for:

- Sending a surprise message to someone you care about  
- Creating a private, cute interaction  
- Gifting a personal web moment

## Created With

A little bit of JavaScript, a pinch of styling, and a whole lot of love.  
Because sometimes, a web page can say what words cannot.
